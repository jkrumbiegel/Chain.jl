## Summary

Chain.jl defines the `@chain` macro. It takes a start value and a `begin ... end` block of expressions.

The result of each expression is fed into the next one using one of two rules:

1. **There is at least one underscore in the expression**
  - every `_` is replaced with the result of the previous expression
2. **There is no underscore**
  - the result of the previous expression is used as the first argument in the current expression, as long as it is a function call, a macro call or a symbol representing a function.

Lines that are prefaced with `@aside` are executed, but their result is not fed into the next pipeline step.
This is very useful to inspect pipeline state during debugging, for example.

## Motivation

- The implicit first argument insertion is useful for many data pipeline scenarios, like `groupby`, `transform` and `combine` in DataFrames.jl
- The `_` syntax is there to either increase legibility or to use functions like `filter` or `map` which need the previous result as the second argument
- There is no need to type `|>` over and over
- Any line can be commented out or in without breaking syntax, there is no problem with dangling `|>` symbols
- The state of the pipeline can easily be checked with the `@aside` macro
- The `begin ... end` block marks very clearly where the macro is applied and works well with auto-indentation
- Because everything is just lines with separate expressions and not one huge function call, IDEs can show exactly in which line errors happened

## Example

An example with a DataFrame:

```julia
using DataFrames, Chain

df = DataFrame(group = [1, 2, 1, 2], weight = [1, 3, 5, 7])

result = @chain df begin
    filter(r -> r.weight < 6, _)
    groupby(:group)
    combine(:weight => sum => :total_weight)
end
```

The pipeless block is equivalent to this:

```julia
result = let
    var1 = filter(r -> r.weight < 6, df)
    var2 = groupby(var1, :group)
    var3 = combine(var2, :weight => sum => :total_weight)
end
```

## The `@aside` macro

For debugging, it's often useful to look at values in the middle of a pipeline.
You can use the `@aside` macro to mark expressions that should not pass on their result.
For these expressions there is no implicit first argument spliced in if there is no `_`, because that would be impractical for most purposes.

If for example, we wanted to know how many groups were created after step 2, we could do this:

```julia
result = @chain df begin
    filter(r -> r.weight < 6, _)
    groupby(:group)
    @aside println("There are $(length(_)) groups after step 2.")
    combine(:weight => sum => :total_weight)
end
```

Which is again equivalent to this:

```julia
result = let
    var1 = filter(r -> r.weight < 6, df)
    var2 = groupby(var1, :group)
    println("There are $(length(var2)) groups after step 2.")
    var3 = combine(var2, :weight => sum => :total_weight)
end
```

## Nested Chains

The `@chain` macro replaces all underscores in the following block, unless it encounters another `@chain` macrocall.
In that case, the only underscore that is still replaced by the outer macro is the first argument of the inner `@chain`.
You can use this, for example, in combination with the `@aside` macro if you need to process a side result further.

```julia
@chain df begin
    filter(r -> r.weight < 6, _)
    @aside @chain _ begin
            select(:group)
            CSV.write("filtered_groups.csv", _)
        end
    groupby(:group)
    combine(:weight => sum => :total_weight)
end
```

## Rewriting Rules

Here is a list of equivalent expressions, where `_` is replaced by `prev` and the new variable is `next`.
In reality, each new variable simply gets a new name via `gensym`, which is guaranteed not to conflict with anything else.

| **Before** | **After** | **Comment** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `sum` | `next = sum(prev)` | Symbol gets expanded into function call |
| `sum(_)` | `next = sum(prev)` | Call expression gets `_` replaced |
| `_ + 3` | `next = prev + 3` | Infix call expressions work the same way as other calls |
| `+(3)` | `next = prev + 3` | Infix notation with _ would look better, but this is also possible |
| `1 + 2` | `next = prev + 1 + 2` | This might feel weird, but `1 + 2` is a normal call expression |
| `filter(isodd, _)` | `next = filter(isodd, prev)` | Underscore can go anywhere |
| `@aside println(_)` | `println(prev)` | `println` without affecting the pipeline; using `_` |
| `@aside println("hello")` | `println("hello")` | `println` without affecting the pipeline; no implicit first arg |
| `@. sin` | `next = sin.(prev)` | Special-cased alternative to `sin.(_)` |
| `@somemacro` | `next = @somemacro(prev)` | Macro calls without arguments get an argument spliced in |
| `@somemacro(x)` | `next = @somemacro(prev, x)` | First argument splicing is the same as with functions |
| `@somemacro(x, _)` | `next = @somemacro(x, prev)` | Also underscore behavior |
